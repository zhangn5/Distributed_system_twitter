- each server can receive messages from all sites
- each server can type in tweets while receiving messages
- has a nice little prompt ">>" indicating that the user can start typing
- when one site is down, it does not affect other sites.
- when a site is up, other sites will discover it once other sites have something to send.
- only implemented "tweet", since only "tweet" should notify other sites. Block, unblock, and view are all local operations, so no need to send these messages to other sites
-  the "block()", "unblock()", "view()", "doSomethingWithReceivedData()" are left empty for Wuu-Berstain algorithm implementation.
